What  is ER Model ?
The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a way to design and represent the data in a database. It helps to clearly define the structure of the data and how different parts are connected. An entity is like an object or a thing you want to store data about.

What is Primary Key?
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. For example, if you have a table of students, each student might have a unique ID number that helps identify them. This primary key ensures there are no duplicates and makes it easy to find specific data.

What is Foreign Key?
A foreign key is used to connect two tables by linking one table's field to the primary key of another table. For instance, in an "Enrollments" table, the foreign key could be the Student ID, which links back to the main "Students" table, showing which student is enrolled in which course.

What is Normalisation?
Normalisation is the process of minimising redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. So, it helps to minimise the redundancy in relations. Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.

First Normal Form (1NF)
 In 1NF, each table cell should contain only a single value, and each column should have a unique name. The first normal form helps to eliminate duplicate data and simplify queries.

Second Normal Form (2NF)
2NF eliminates redundant data by requiring that each non-key attribute be dependent on the primary key. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to other columns.

Third Normal Form (3NF)
3NF builds on 2NF by requiring that all non-key attributes are independent of each other. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to any other columns in the same table.

Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF that ensures that each determinant in a table is a candidate key. In other words, BCNF ensures that each non-key attribute is dependent only on the candidate key.

Advantage of Normal Form 
Reduced data redundancy 
Improved data consistency
Simplified Database Design
Easier Database Maintenance
